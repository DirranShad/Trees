# Trees: Creatio ex nihilo

The game of Trees is one that guides you to conquer all in your sight from nothing but a patch of dirt and a tree.

You must utilise the tree, get saplings, plant more trees, make more dirt - until you conquer entire planets with your tree creations.

All we can say is... good luck on your journey.
